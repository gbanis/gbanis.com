![Sublime Text 3 Go To Method Gif](/assets/goto-definition-sublime-text-3.gif)

I just learned how to **quickly** navigate to the definition of a method / function / class... just about anything.

In this example, I am using Sublime Text 3 but I am sure most of the text editors should have similar functionality.

All you have to do is select the method that you want to search for and then either:

- Navigate to: "Goto" > "Goto Definition"
- Use the shortcut: option + command + down

Enjoy!
