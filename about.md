<img style="float:right" src="/assets/george-banis.jpg" height="180"> Hey there, my name is George Banis and I am a full-stack developer with a multimedia and marketing background.

Lately, I've been coding mostly in Ruby and JavaScript, which I thoroughly enjoy.

I usually work on building:

- RESTful API servers using Ruby on Rails and
- Front-end SPAs (single page applications) using AngularJS

I really enjoy test-driven development and continuous integration. I also love using Git to document my progress and work with teams.

## Volunteering

I currently serve as a **board member** at [NewTV](http://newtv.org), Newton's award-winning community media center. During my time here, we were recognized as the best community media center in the country. In addition, one of our shows, "[The Folklorist](http://folklorist.newtv.org/)", has received multiple Emmy awards.

I am also a **founding member** of the [N-squared Corridor](http://n2corridor.com), an initiative that promotes the Newton-Needham corridor as an entrepreneurial and technological hub.
