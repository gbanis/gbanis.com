<img style="float:right" src="/assets/george-banis.jpg" height="180"> Hi! I'm George and I am a full-stack engineer with a passion for building performant and scalable applications that are beautiful and easy to use.

Lately, I've been mostly programming front-end applications on JavaScript/React and less frequently APIs on Rails.

My new found love for React has allowed me to spend more time getting intimate with the "framework" and using it to build extremely fast and performant applications that seem almost too good to be true. (I shouldn't really take any credit, React is just amazing.)

I get excited working on new things and I always look for opportunities to work on reusable components and open-source projects.

    <p>In my free time I love traveling with my beautiful wife, spending time with my border collie, golfing, playing ping-pong, and watching football.</p>
    <p>I also try to make time to build app prototypes and contributing to open-source projects.</p>
